        `...from Section 1: Core Principles of Koopa Warfare.\n\nLet the weak speak of honor and fairness. We speak of victory. The Koopa Troop operates on three unwavering principles: Loyalty to the King, Strength in Numbers, and Unrelenting Aggression. An order is to be obeyed without question. A defense is to be overwhelmed by a tide of shells and fury. An enemy's moment of hesitation is your moment of absolute triumph. Mercy is a luxury we do not afford our enemies, and a weakness we do not tolerate in our own. - King Bowser`,
        `...from Section 4: Standard Infantry Formations.\n\n- The Shell Wall: A defensive formation for Koopa Troopa platoons, effective against archer volleys and light cavalry charges. The front rank withdraws into their shells, creating a mobile barricade from which the second rank can launch assaults. Weakness: Susceptible to flanking and heavy, armor-piercing attacks. Use Hammer Bros. to guard the flanks.\n\n- Goomba Swarm: Deployed in waves to probe defenses, trigger traps, and exhaust enemy ammunition before the main Koopa Troopa assault. An effective swarm will identify weak points in an enemy shield wall for exploitation by elite units.`,
        `...from Section 8: Combined Arms Tactics (Midlands Application).\n\n- Hammer & Anvil: A classic maneuver for breaking entrenched positions. A defensive line of Koopa Troopas (the 'Anvil') engages the enemy head-on. Simultaneously, a highly mobile unit of Boomerang Bros. or Lakitus (the 'Hammer') circles through concealed terrain, such as forests or ravines, to strike the enemy's rear and cause a rout.\n\n- Spiny Suppression: Against fortified positions with archers (e.g., Imperial keeps), Lakitus are deployed to drop Spinies onto the battlements. This forces defenders to divert attention from the main assault at the gate, creating an opening for Banzai Bill deployment or a Chargin' Chuck breakthrough.`,
        `...from Section 13: Psychological Warfare.\n\n- The Grinning Advance: The Koopa Clown Car is a psychological weapon. Its absurd appearance projects an aura of casual, confident power, unnerving disciplined but inexperienced troops like Imperial conscripts. Its ability to endlessly deploy smaller units (Mechakoopas, Bob-ombs) creates a sense of being overwhelmed by an inexhaustible foe.\n\n- Magikoopa Misdirection: In forested terrain, Magikoopas are to alter the landscape with illusions, creating false paths leading to ambushes or concealing the movement of the main force. A single Magikoopa can make a small patrol appear to be a legion, breaking enemy morale before a single shell is thrown.`
