Ancient texts speak of his ability to devour souls and incorporate their knowledge and abilities into his own. The darkness he commands is said to be sentient, a living extension of his will that hungers for life. Witnesses claim to have seen him split into multiple shadow forms, each capable of independent action, while his true body remains hidden.

He established a fortress in the darkest corner of the Midlands, where no sunlight ever penetrates, and began plotting to collect all fragments for himself. He has already attempted to absorb the Ice Toad's fragment but was thwarted by the adventurers who now possess it. Ancient prophecies speak of him as 'The Star Devourer' who will bring eternal darkness if not stopped.",

He kept the Core Shard for himself and distributed the others to trusted followers who would become the Toad Guardians. What few know is that he deliberately corrupted each fragment differently, ensuring that their powers would drive their bearers toward specific goals—all part of a grand design that has been unfolding for centuries. His true motivation remains unknown, but ancient texts suggest he seeks to reshape the Midlands into something 'beyond mortal comprehension.'",
